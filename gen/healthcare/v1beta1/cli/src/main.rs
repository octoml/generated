This method is optimized to load large quantities of data using\nimport semantics that ignore some FHIR store configuration options and are\nnot suitable for all use cases. It is primarily intended to load data into\nan empty FHIR store that is not being used by other clients. In cases\nwhere this method is not appropriate, consider using ExecuteBundle to\nload data.\n\nEvery resource in the input must contain a client-supplied ID, and will be\nstored using that ID regardless of the\nenable_update_create setting on the FHIR\nstore.\n\nThe import process does not enforce referential integrity, regardless of\nthe\ndisable_referential_integrity\nsetting on the FHIR store. This allows the import of resources with\narbitrary interdependencies without considering grouping or ordering, but\nif the input data contains invalid references or if some resources fail to\nbe imported, the FHIR store might be left in a state that violates\nreferential integrity.\n\nThe import process does not trigger Cloud Pub/Sub notification or BigQuery\nstreaming update, regardless of how those are configured on the FHIR store.\n\nIf a resource with the specified ID already exists, the most recent\nversion of the resource is overwritten without creating a new historical\nversion, regardless of the\ndisable_resource_versioning\nsetting on the FHIR store. If transient failures occur during the import,\nit is possible that successfully imported resources will be overwritten\nmore than once.\n\nThe import operation is idempotent unless the input data contains multiple\nvalid resources with the same ID but different contents. In that case,\nafter the import completes, the store will contain exactly one resource\nwith that ID but there is no ordering guarantee on which version of the\ncontents it will have. The operation result counters do not count\nduplicate IDs as an error and will count one success for each resource in\nthe input, which might result in a success count larger than the number\nof resources in the FHIR store. This often occurs when importing data\norganized in bundles produced by Patient-everything\nwhere each bundle contains its own copy of a resource such as Practitioner\nthat might be referred to by many patients.\n\nIf some resources fail to import, for example due to parsing errors,\nsuccessfully imported resources are not rolled back.\n\nThe location and format of the input data is specified by the parameters\nbelow. Note that if no format is specified, this method assumes the\n`BUNDLE` format. When using the `BUNDLE` format this method ignores the\n`Bundle.type` field, except that `history` bundles are rejected, and does\nnot apply any of the bundle processing semantics for batch or transaction\nbundles. Unlike in ExecuteBundle, transaction bundles are not executed\nas a single transaction and bundle-internal references are not rewritten.\nThe bundle is treated as a collection of resources to be written as\nprovided in `Bundle.entry.resource`, ignoring `Bundle.entry.request`. As\nan example, this allows the import of `searchset` bundles produced by a\nFHIR search or\nPatient-everything operation.\n\nThis method returns an Operation that can\nbe used to track the status of the import by calling\nGetOperation.\n\nImmediate fatal errors appear in the\nerror field, errors are also logged\nto Cloud Logging (see [Viewing\nlogs](/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)). Otherwise, when the\noperation finishes, a detailed response of type ImportResourcesResponse\nis returned in the response field.\nThe metadata field type for this\noperation is OperationMetadata.");

If\nthere are additional results, the returned `Bundle` will contain\npagination links.\n\nResources with a total size larger than 5MB or a field count larger than\n50,000 might not be fully searchable as the server might trim its generated\nsearch index in those cases.\n\nNote: FHIR resources are indexed asynchronously, so there might be a slight\ndelay between the time a resource is created or changes and when the change\nis reflected in search results.");
